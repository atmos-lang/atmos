# 1. Tasks & Events

Tasks are the basic units of execution in Atmos.

The `spawn` primitive starts a task from a function prototype:

```
func T (...) {
    ...
}
pin t1 = spawn T(...)   ;; starts `t1`
pin t2 = spawn T(...)   ;; starts `t2`
...                     ;; t1 & t2 started and are now waiting
```

The [`pin`](manual-out.md#declarations-and-assignments) declaration, which we
detail further, limits the task lifetime within the current scope.

<!--
Tasks are based on Lua coroutines, meaning that they rely on cooperative
scheduling with explicit suspension points.
The key difference is that tasks can react to each other through events.
-->

The `await` primitive suspends a task until a matching event occurs:

```
func T (i) {
    await :X
    print("task " ++ i ++ " awakes on X")
}
```

In the example, `:X` is a [tag](manual-out.md#hierarchical-tags) that
identifies the event.

The `emit` primitive broadcasts an event, awaking all tasks awaiting it:

```
spawn T(1)
spawn T(2)
emit :X
    ;; "task 1 awakes on X"
    ;; "task 2 awakes on X"
```

Therefore, based on the `await` and `emit` primitives, Atmos supports
*reactive scheduling* for tasks.

# 2. External Environments

An environment is the external component that bridges input events from the
real world into an Atmos application.
These events can be timers, key presses, network packets, or other kinds of
inputs, depending on the environment.

The environment is loaded through `require`, making the application ready to
handle events:

```
require "x"         ;; environment "x" with events X.A, X.B, ...

await :X.A          ;; awakes when "x" emits "X.A"
```

The environment internally executes a continuous loop that polls external
events from the real world and forwards them to Atmos through `emit` calls.
The main body of the program is an anonymous task that can await and react to
the environment.

The next example relies on the built-in [clock environment](atmos/env/clock/)
to count 5 seconds:

```
require "atmos.env.clock"

print "Counts 5 seconds:"
loop _ in 5 {
    await @1
    print "1 second..."
}
print "5 seconds elapsed."
```

In the example, `@1` is a [clock value](manual-out.md#clock) in the format
`@HH:MM:SS.sss`, allowing Atmos to await time.

# 3. Lexical Structure

In Atmos, the lexical organization of tasks determines their lifetimes and also
how they are scheduled, which helps to reason about programs more statically,
based on the source code.

## 3.1. Lexical Scheduling

The reactive scheduler of Atmos is deterministic and cooperative:

1. `deterministic`:
    When multiple tasks spawn or awake concurrently, they activate in the order
    they appear in the source code.
2. `cooperative`:
    When a task spawns or awakes, it takes full control of the application and
    executes until it awaits or terminates.

Consider the following code, which spawns two anonymous tasks concurrently and
await the same event `:X`:

<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
print "1"
spawn {         ;; task #1
    print "a1"
    await :X
    print "a2"
}
print "2"
spawn {         ;; task #2
    print "b1"
    await :X
    print "b2"
}
print "3"
emit :X
print "4"
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
;; Output:
;; 1
;; a1
;; 2
;; b1
;; 3
;; a2
;; b2
;; 4
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

In the example, the scheduling behaves as follows:

- Main application prints `1` and spawns the first task.
- The first task takes control, prints `a1`, and suspends, returning the
  control back to the main application.
- The main application prints `2` and spawns the second task.
- The second task starts, prints `b1`, and suspends.
- The main application prints `3`, and broadcasts `:X`.
- The first task awakes, prints `a2`, and suspends.
- The second task awakes, prints `b2`, and suspends.
- The main application prints `4`.

## 3.2. Lexical Hierarchy

Tasks form a hierarchy based on the source position in which they are spawned.
Therefore, the lexical structure of the program determines the lifetime of
tasks.

In the next example, the outer task terminates and aborts the inner task before
it has the chance to awake:

```
spawn {
    spawn {
        await :Y    ;; never awakes after :X occurs
        print "never prints"
    }
    await :X        ;; awakes and aborts the whole task hierarchy
}
emit :X
emit :Y
```

`TODO: pin (not for anon/compounds)`

### 3.2.1. Deferred Statements

A task can register deferred statements to execute when they terminate or abort
within its hierarchy:

```
spawn {
    spawn {
        defer {
            print "nested task aborted"
        }
        await(false) ;; never awakes
    }
} ;; aborts the nested task and executes the defer clause
```

The nested spawned task never awakes, but executes its `defer` clause when
its enclosing hierarchy terminates.

Tasks and deferred statements can also be attached to the scope of explicit
blocks:

```
do {
    spawn {
        <...>   ;; aborted with the enclosing `do`
    }
    defer {
        <...>   ;; aborted with the enclosing `do`
    }
    <...>
} ;; executes defer clauses in the block and in nested tasks
```

In the example, we attach a `spawn` and a `defer` to an explicit block.
When the block goes out of scope, it automatically aborts the task and also
executes the deferred statement.
The aborted task may also have pending defers, which also execute immediately.
The defers execute in the reverse order in which they appear in the source
code.

# 4. Compound Statements

Atmos provides many compound statements built on top of tasks:

- The `every` statement expands to a loop that awaits its first argument at the
  beginning of each iteration:

```
every @1 {
    print "1 second elapses"    ;; prints every second
}
```

- The `watching` statement awaits the given body to terminate, or aborts if its
  first argument occurs:

```
watching @1 {
    await :X
    print "X happens before 1s" ;; prints unless 1 second elapses
}
```

- The `par`, `par_and`, `par_or` statements spawn multiple bodies and rejoin
  after their bodies terminates: `par` never rejoins, `par_and`
  rejoins after all terminate, `par_or` rejoins after any terminates:

```
par_and {
    await :X
} with {
    await :Y
} with {
    await :Z
}
print "X, Y, and Z occurred"
```

# 5. Functional Streams

Functional data streams represent incoming values over continuous time, and can
be combined a pipeline for real-time processing.
Atmos extends the [f-streams][f-streams] library to interoperate with tasks
and events.

The next example creates a stream that awaits occurrences of event `X`:

```
val S = require "atmos.streams"
spawn {
    S.fr_await(:X)
        ::tap(xprint)
        ::filter \{ (it.v % 2) == 1 }
        ::map \{ it.v }
        ::tap(print)
        ::to()
}
loop i in 10 {
    await @.1
    emit :X @{v=i}
}
```

The example spawns a dedicated task for the stream pipeline with source
`S.fr_await(:X)`, which runs concurrently with a loop that generates events
`:X` carrying field `v=i` on every second.
The pipeline filters only odd occurrences of `v`, then maps to these values,
and prints them.
The syntax `\{ ... }` creates an anonymous function with a single parameter
`it`.
The call to sink `to()` activates the stream and starts to pull values from
the source, making the task to await.
The loop takes 10 seconds to emit `1,2,...,10`, whereas the stream takes 10
seconds to print `1,3,...,9`.

The full stream pipeline of the example is analogous to an awaiting loop as
follows:

```
loop {
    print(map(filter(await(:X))))
}
```

Atmos also provides stateful streams by supporting tasks as stream sources.
The next example creates a task stream that packs awaits to `:X` and `:Y` in
sequence:

```
func T () {
    await :X
    await :Y
}
spawn {
    S.fr_await(T)           ;; XY, XY, ...
        ::zip(S.from(1))    ;; {XY,1}, {XY,2} , ...
        ::map \{ it[2] }    ;; 1, 2, ...
        ::take(2)           ;; 1, 2
        ::tap(print)
        ::to()
}
emit :X
emit :X
emit :Y     ;; 1
emit :X
emit :Y     ;; 2
emit :Y
```

In the example, `S.fr_await(T)` is a stream of complete executions of task `T`.
Therefore, each item is generated only after `X` and `Y` occur in sequence.
The pipeline is zipped with an increasing sequence of numbers, and then mapped
to only generate the numbers.
The example only takes the first two numbers, prints them, and terminates.

# 6. More about Tasks

## 6.1. Public Data

The special variable `pub` holds public data inside tasks:

```
func T () {
    set pub = 10
}
pin t = spawn T()
print(t.pub) ;; 10
```

In the example, `t.pub` acesses the public data of task `t`.

## 6.2. Task Pools

A task pool, created with `tasks` primitive, allows that multiple tasks share a
parent container in the hierarchy.
When the pool goes out of scope, all attached tasks are aborted.
When a task terminates, it is automatically removed from the pool.

```
func T (id, ms) {
    set pub = id
    print(:start, id, ms)
    await @ms
    print(:stop, id, ms)
}

do {
    pin ts = tasks()
    loop i in 10 {
        spawn [ts] T(i, math.random(500,1500))
    }
    await @1
}
```

In the example, we first create a pool `ts`.
Then we use `spawn [ts]` to spawn and attach 10 tasks into the pool.
Each task sleeps between `500ms` and `1500ms` before terminating.
After `1s`, the `ts` block goes out of scope, aborting all tasks that did not
complete.

It is possible to iterate over a task pool to traverse its currently attached
tasks:

```
loop _,t in ts {
    print(t.pub)
}
```

If we include this loop after the `await @1` in the previous example, it will
print the task ids that did not awake.

## 6.3. Task Toggling

A task can be toggled off (and back to on) to remain alive but unresponsive
(and back to responsive) to upcoming events:

```
pin t = spawn (\{
    await :X
    print "awakes from X"
}) ()
toggle t(false)
emit :X     ;; ignored
toggle t(true)
emit :X     ;; awakes
```

The `toggle` statement awaits the given body to terminate, while also observing
its first argument as a boolean event:
When receiving `false`, the body toggles off.
When receiving `true`, the body toggles on.

```
spawn {
    toggle :X {
        every @.100 {
            print "100ms elapses"
        }
    }
}
print 'off'
emit(:X, false)    ;; body above toggles off
await @1
print 'on'
emit(:X, true)     ;; body above toggles on
await @1
```

# 7. Errors

Atmos provides `throw` and `catch` primitives to handle errors, which take in
consideration the task hierarchy, i.e., a parent task catches errors from child
tasks.

```
func T () {
    spawn {
        await :X
        throw :Y
    }
    await(false)
}

spawn {
    val ok, err = catch :Y {
        spawn T()
        await(false)
    }
    print(ok, err)
}

emit :X

;; "false, Y"
```

In the example, we spawn a parent task that catches errors of type `:Y`.
Then we spawn a named task `T`, which spawns an anonymous task, which awaits
`:X` to finally throw `:Y`.
Outside the task hierarchy, we `emit :X`, which only awakes the nested task.
Nevertheless, the error propagates up in the task hierarchy until it is caught
by the top-level task, returning `false` and the error `:Y`.

## 7.1. Bidimensional Stack Traces

An error trace may cross multiple tasks from a series of emits and awaits,
e.g.: an `emit` in one task awakes an `await` in another task, which may `emit`
and match an `await` in a third task.
However, *cross-task traces* do not inform how each task in the trace started
and reached its `emit`, i.e. each of the *intra-task* traces, which is as much
as insightful to understand the errors.

Atmos provides bidimensional stack traces, which include cross-task and
intra-task traces.

In the next example, we spawn 3 tasks in `ts`, and then `emit` an event
targeting the task with `id=2`.
Only this task awakes and generates an uncaught error:

```
funct T (id) {
    await(:X, id)
    throw :error
}

pin ts = tasks()
spawn [ts] T(1)
spawn [ts] T(2)
spawn [ts] T(3)

emit(:X, 2)
```

The stack trace identifies that the task lives in `ts` in line 6 and spawns in
line 8, before throwing the error in line 3:

```
==> ERROR:
 |  x.lua:11 (emit)
 v  x.lua:3 (throw) <- x.lua:8 (task) <- x.lua:6 (tasks)
==> error
```
